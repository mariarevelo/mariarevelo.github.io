I migrated from Colombia to the United States months before starting high school. During my high school years, the Hispanic society I was part of allowed me to connect more with the Hispanic community, having different presentations in which the community's struggle was presented to create awareness of all the difficulties our community has to endure here. Besides connecting with the culture by celebrating important Hispanic dates that represent who we are, collecting funds for low-income families was also one of our goals. I also volunteered at schools to help kids with homework during that time. I remember meeting kids who did not speak English and connecting with them because they were exactly like me. We were struggling to adapt to this country, but we knew we had to be brave enough to confront it and continue. After some years, my English improved, and I continued volunteering and spreading my culture at school. 
All the years of struggle for me and my parents were worth it once I received the acceptance letter from UCR. The idea of being able to study psychology and pursue that dream goal of reaching a doctoral degree to become a clinical psychologist seemed closer and closer. The idea of being able to help kids and adults who are struggling psychologically because of their immigration struggles would be a fulfilling experience for me. Being able to help them professionally and being able to listen to them is something they don't get here because, sadly, even if our intentions are good, we are not heard here. 
My volunteer experience with children has helped me see the struggles children have in basic places like school, and the idea that most of the problems come from home. The idea of being able to give therapy to families and even specialize in certain conditions has created a big motivation in me to try to pursue even more in my academic career. The different approaches that psychology has are incredibly interesting and my goal is to become a clinical psychologist helping my patients with their emotional distresses and basically make an impact with my work. 
Another of my volunteering experiences was at a residence for older people teached me a lot. The idea that I got to help older people by giving them emotional support filled me with happiness starting with the fact that I got to learn so much from their life stories, their ‚Äú golden years‚Äù as they call them and all the joy it brings them to speak about it. The idea of accompanying them when not everyone seems to care is recomforting because I was able to see the happiness in their faces every time I went. Psychologically I feel they helped me understand what life is about the importance of the people around you and how when we are younger we don't analyze those things and therefore don't really appreciate them as we should. The experience I got from interacting with them was something I had never experienced before and therefore I am really thankful I got to.
